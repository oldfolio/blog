<p>Wow. It has been two years since I have posted to this blog, and I suspect it may be two years more before I post again. When I studied physics hand-held calculators were still something of an anomaly. We used slide rules. So, I was interested in the slide rule reflections over at the <a href="http://misc-stuff.terraaeon.com/articles/slide-rule-prices.html">Miscellaneous Stuff</a> blog.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...slide rules are an elegant computing solution. They require no power. They last forever. And, they work well enough to solve most problems where an individual understands the basic principles associated with the problem he is trying to solve.</p>

<p>Some reflections on the future of computing at the <a href="http://misc-stuff.terraaeon.com/articles/locked-down-computers.html">Miscellaneous Stuff</a> blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The future of personal computing looks rather bleak to me... They are making it harder and harder for us to do what we want with our computers. They are successfully taking away our general-purpose computers and replacing them with little more than Internet appliances...</p>

<p>I am not looking forward to a near-term future in which my operating system is so locked down that I cannot install the software I want. Many have already reached this future.</p>

<p>From Carl Svensson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Too many pages rely far too heavily on a presumptive user having the latest browser, fastest computer and highest bandwidth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole <a href="https://datagubbe.se/colophon/">article</a> is worth a read -- as are Svensson's other musings.</p>
