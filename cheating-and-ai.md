Cheating and AI

So, I recently stumbled on this [little post][cheating] by Terence Eden:

>I'm now in the middle of writing up my MSc dissertation. I'm doing it in Google Docs - because I'm a masochist.
>Google Docs has a useful feature called Smart Suggestions which â†’ offers to autocomplete your sentences.
>Is *that* cheating?
>I've signed a declaration to my University saying that my dissertation is all my own work. But it isn't.
>Google's AI suggested a couple of dozen sentences...
> 
>Google Docs knows what I want to write before I write it. Am I merely the *editor* of machine generated text?
