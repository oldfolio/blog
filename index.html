<p>So, I recently stumbled on this <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2022/11/is-it-cheating-to-use-spell-check/">little post</a> by Terence Eden:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm now in the middle of writing up my MSc dissertation. I'm doing it in Google Docs - because I'm a masochist.
Google Docs has a useful feature called Smart Suggestions which → offers to autocomplete your sentences.
Is <em>that</em> cheating?
I've signed a declaration to my University saying that my dissertation is all my own work. But it isn't.
Google's AI suggested a couple of dozen sentences...</p>

<p>Google Docs knows what I want to write before I write it. Am I merely the <em>editor</em> of machine generated text?</p>

<p>A few months ago, Carlos Fenollosa (the creator of bashblog, the script I use to generate this site) <a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/after-self-hosting-my-email-for-twenty-three-years-i-have-thrown-in-the-towel-the-oligopoly-has-won.html">wrote</a> about his decision to quit self-hosting his email after more than twenty years of doing so. He lays out the problems faced by individuals who self-host email and concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One cannot reliably deploy independent email servers...</p>

<p>You cannot set up a home email server.</p>

<p>You cannot set it up on a VPS.</p>

<p>You cannot set it up on your own datacenter. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fenollosa’s post generated significant discussion at <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/icdrmv/after_self_hosting_my_email_for_twenty">Lobste.rs</a> in which Fastmail’s Rob Mueller offers some very thoughtful reflections on the state of email today. Because many of the problems faced by Fenollosa are driven by the pervasiveness of spam (as Fenollosa himself recognizes) <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/icdrmv/after_self_hosting_my_email_for_twenty#c_erae4n">Mueller elaborates</a> on the problem of spam. Spam is big business and driven by big money.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s different ways to count it, but there’s capital-B Billions lost to this shit every year. And with that comes small-country-sized amounts of resources to throw at making sure the spam gets through...</p>

<p>People sending spam can and do spend good money...; they’ll pay for the top-tier accounts...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the email environment in which we operate today.</p>

<p>Wow. It has been two years since I have posted to this blog, and I suspect it may be two years more before I post again. When I studied physics hand-held calculators were still something of an anomaly. We used slide rules. So, I was interested in the slide rule reflections over at the <a href="http://misc-stuff.terraaeon.com/articles/slide-rule-prices.html">Miscellaneous Stuff</a> blog.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...slide rules are an elegant computing solution. They require no power. They last forever. And, they work well enough to solve most problems where an individual understands the basic principles associated with the problem he is trying to solve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>Miscellaneous Stuff</em> author is worried that fewer and fewer people understand the “basic principles” of the problems they are addressing. I think he may be right about that.</p>

<p>Some reflections on the future of computing at the <a href="http://misc-stuff.terraaeon.com/articles/locked-down-computers.html">Miscellaneous Stuff</a> blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The future of personal computing looks rather bleak to me... They are making it harder and harder for us to do what we want with our computers. They are successfully taking away our general-purpose computers and replacing them with little more than Internet appliances...</p>

<p>I am not looking forward to a near-term future in which my operating system is so locked down that I cannot install the software I want. Many have already reached this future.</p>

<p>From Carl Svensson:</p>

  <p>Too many pages rely far too heavily on a presumptive user having the latest browser, fastest computer and highest bandwidth.</p>

<p>The whole <a href="https://datagubbe.se/colophon/">article</a> is worth a read -- as are Svensson's other musings.</p>
