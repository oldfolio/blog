The Original Bashblog

One more change to the blog: I originally started this blog simply in order to experiment with [David Wallin’s revision][wallin] of [Carlos Fenollosa’s bashblog][fenollosa] script. Wallin had wanted to add more features without undermining the simplicity of Fenollos’a original script. Both scripts are actively maintained, and both are great tools for creating simple, static blogs. I do not really need the extra features that Wallin wanted to introduce, and since I am always trying to “[simplify, simplify][simplify]” I decided to switch from using Wallin’s script to using Fenollosa’s script to generate this blog. At this point, though, there is not much difference. Fenollosa’s script is 1194 lines where Wallin’s is 1267 lines.
