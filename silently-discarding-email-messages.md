Silently Discarding Email Messages

So I see this as both a user-disempowering practice and one which is detrimental to the email ecosystem.

This is exactly my own thinking on the issue. Silently rejecting messages that were sent to me is a deal-breaker for me. I do not care how good your email service otherwise is, or what features you offer, if you silently discard any messages, then I will not use your service as my primary email hosting.
