Bashblog, Next Generation

[David Wallin][1] has updated [Carlos Fenollosa][2]'s bashblog script. For a blogging platform I always seem to go back to bashblog because I have never found any other platform that was simpler or more elegant. I am still trying to learn how Wallin's script differs from Fenolloa's.

What I would like to determine is how feasible it would be to use the script to generate non-blog static sites. Manually processing markdown files might be easier than trying to tweak the script, but tweakng the script is a learning opportunity even if it does not yield a static site maintenance tool that I can use.
