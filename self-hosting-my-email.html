<p>Over the years, I have periodically set up and run my own email server. For the most part, these experiments were simply for learning purposes. I wanted to understand for myself what was involved in running a mail server, but I always took for granted that I would entrust the hosting of my primary email address to someone else -- someone who maintained mail servers for a living, someone working full-time at maintaining the mail server where my address would be managed.</p>

<p>Through all these years, though, I never found an email provider that fully suited me. There are a number of solid, reliable email hosts out there. Inevitably, though, there would be details about each of their services that bothered me. I ended up migrating from one email host to another, never quite satisfied with any of them. So, a couple of weeks ago, I bit the bullet and moved email for my primary domain to a server I am managing myself. Today, I moved email for my secondary domain to that server as well. (Don't worry: I have additional, lower-priority MX records pointing to a backup email solution.)</p>

<p>The final straw was discovering that my provider was silently discarding legitimate messages in an overly aggressive attempt to combat spam. Some of these were personal messages. Some were log-in verification codes that some services send when you log in from a new IP address. The point is that these messages were definitely not spam. I wanted to receive them. In the case of the log-in verification codes, I needed them. If the provider thought that the messages were suspicious, then the messages could have been directed to a spam folder. They weren't. They were simply discarded before they ever reached my account. That is a deal breaker for me.</p>

<p>I don't know how long my foray into self-hosting will last. It may be just another leg of the journey in my restless migration from one host to another. I do know this, though: I really like being able to look at the server logs myself. I'm not sure I could go back to a solution where I cannot do that.</p>
