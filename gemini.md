Gemini

Over at [Old Vintage Computing Research][oldvcr], Cameron Kaiser offers a nice comparative analysis of Gopher and the new Gemini protocal. As Kaiser puts it, "Gemini isn't going to displace Gopher — though in fairness nor does it try — because it just simply doesn't scratch the same itches." The whole article is well worth a read.
